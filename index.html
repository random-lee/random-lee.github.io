  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm a science to data science (<a href="http://www.s2ds.org/">S2DS</a>) fellow, former CERN particle physicist and genuinely inquisitive person, who is keen to
utilize insightful and innovative ways to use data. I have been actively working towards this goal by getting involved with
data science related events, to build my knowledge of the latest developments and to get to know the community, and
occasionally giving presentations of my work. I'm now looking for data science roles, where I will be challenged by
unfamiliar ideas, have the chance to share experiences with a range of co-workers and provide results that enable people
to make smarter decisions.</p>

        <p>Worked with Opensensors to construct and carry out a 5 week exploratory data analysis project using their internet of
things platform. The project ended up focusing on a network of sensors that were located in the residential areas around
Heathrow, and monitored air and noise pollution. The main goal was to make the real time noisy data more accessible to
interested residents.</p>

        <p>Currently working on a boardgame recommendation system based on data obtained from a café and scraping related
websites. Have shown the first version of the system to café staff and had feedback from them, which has lead to ideas
for improvements to the next version. The motivation for this project was to answer a personal question, but hopefully the
resulting system will be useful to both staff and customers, looking to try new boardgames.</p>
